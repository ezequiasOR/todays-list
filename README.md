# [Today's List](https://ezequiasor.github.io/todays-list/)

This to-do list is based on the book How to Become a Straight-A Student by Cal Newport where he explains how to manage your time more carefully in order to switch your studying schedule and to start working in short but intense bursts.

### Breve summary:

You will need a calendar where you write all your deadlines and upcoming tasks. It is also important to use a [list](https://ezequiasor.github.io/todays-list/) with your daily schedule (the “Today’s Schedule” column) and to jot down any new tasks that you encounter during the day (the “Things to Remember” column). Spend at least five to ten minutes in the morning checking your calendar and making updates.

# [To-Do List](https://todo-ezequiasr.herokuapp.com)

## Contributing
Feel free to submit PRs for small issues. For large issues or features, open an issue first.

### Option 1 - Simple Typo Fixes
For small issues, like a typo or broken link, use Github's inline file editor or web editor(open by pressing `.` in your fork's code tab) to make the fix and submit a pull request to the `dev` branch.

### Option 2 - Work on your own Fork
For more complex contributions, like a new features, you should work on the project on your local system.

⚛️ First, fork this repo on GitHub.

    $ git clone <your-forked-repo>
    $ cd todays-list
    $ yarn
    $ npm start ou yarn start
    
    $ git checkout dev
    $ git checkout -b my-fix
    # fix some code...
    
    $ git commit -m "fix: corrected a typo"
    $ git push -u origin my-fix

Lastly, open a pull request to the `dev` branch on GitHub. Once merged (with the branch `master`), your changes will automatically be deployed to the live site.
